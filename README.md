# TDA breast density

Breast density can be defined as the amount of white and bright regions seen on a mammogram. Knowing that cancer is more likely to develop in women with dense breast tissue, and that it's harder to detect cancer in breasts with denser tissue ('masking' issue), we want to find a way to accurately and objectively measure breast density, in a way that is independent from human evaluation and mammogram machine maker.
